				<h2>Provide a Benefit</h2>
				

<p>
    As good as a story is at hitting the reasons why the company is great, consumers need to know: "What's in it for me?" The blurb should focus on one or two key benefits. Let consumers know what they get when they do business with the company. Examples of benefits might be convenience, superior products, award-winning services or customization for the customer's needs. For example, a promotional product provider might express the benefit like this: "Be remembered in a way as unique as your company."
            </p>

				<h2>Search Engine Needs</h2>
				

<p>If your blurb will be online, make sure it is search engine optimized – SEO – with keywords. Keywords and phrases are the most common words and phrases that your target audience will use to search for information. Include the most popular SEO phrases to help improve search rank when consumers search for something via Google or Bing</p>

				<h2>Tell a Story
                </h2>
				

<p>The blurb isn't a scholarly excerpt. A company paragraph that tells a story will engage the reader. Good storytelling builds positive brand awareness and makes the company memorable to consumers. Ideally, readers then begin to look at other information about products and services. For example, an organic coffee brand might talk about the origins of the beans, "Sustainable farming methods in the fertile high-altitude regions of Chile...." The messaging goal aims to hit the emotional triggers such as earth consciousness and global warming.</p>
